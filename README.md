# CS2040C Codes
This repository contains source codes that I did when I was studying for the National University of Singapore's School of Computing CS2040C module.

This module is the sibling of CS2040, where they use Java instead of C++.

For more information about the module, visit this website: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/cs2040c.html

## Disclaimer Warning
Not all the source codes found in this repository will give you "Accepted" as I may have coded it halfway or have given up on it.

I will try to mark the questions which I have not completed, if I remember them.

### Incomplete Questions
Not only are these questions incomplete, this list is also incomplete.
- [ ] PS0/Subtask D
- [ ] PS1/Subtask C
- [x] uVA/argus (Not tested)
- [ ] Kattis/trainsorting

## Kattis
All the question's file names are the question IDs.

### Example
`Single source shortest path, time table`'s url is https://open.kattis.com/problems/shortestpath2, meaning the file name will be [`Kattis/shortestpath2.cpp`](Kattis/shortestpath2.cpp)

## Codeforces
All the question's file names are named based on their numeric ID and subtask ID.

### Example
`Mr. Kitayuta's Colorful Graph`'s url http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/505/B, meaning the file name will be [`B505.cpp`](Codeforces/B505.cpp).
